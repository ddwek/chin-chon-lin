chin-chon-lin
=============

chin-chon-lin is a game of cards for GNU/Linux whose main goal is group
cards and make combos. You can group your cards by either suit or number.
The former of those possible combinations is internally known as "stairs",
where as the latter is simply known as "groups".

When you run the game for the first time, you will be able to see how the
deck distributes its cards, which are seven cards for each of the four
players. Next, and every time the board's turn indicates that is your turn
to play, you will have to choose the source where you get one card from.
It can be the deck (the heap of cards stacked at left-center of the window)
or the stack of played cards, east of the deck. Then, you must to get rid
of one of your cards, most likely that you consider it useless.

Once done, you must to wait for the other players do the same with their
cards. Repeat your acquisitions and discards over and over again until you
have made the more combos of three / four cards each as you can and end the
current round by pressing the secondary mouse button (usually, the right
one). Finally, you will see the table of scores, with the scores computed
for the four players, which is described in the next section.

Computing scores
================

At the end of each round, a message dialog containing info about the round
scores and total scores for the players is shown on screen. As you can take
a look the source code, the algorithm for scores calculating is really
straightforward. First of all, we add the number of each card and then we
subtract it both groups and stairs combos based on their numbers as well.
Note that suit of each card is meaningless.

When does the game end?
=======================

After every round finished, you can see the table of scores and compare
your total scores with your adversaries. Despite of the Total Limit to
reach is configurable, whether one player exceeds such a limit the game
is over and the player with the least "Total Score" wins the match.

What else should I know to start playing this game?
===================================================

The most important hint to keep in mind is just try to collect and make
combos with low-numbered cards. That way, if someone ends the round before
than you, the amount to sum in the field "This Round" of the "Table of
Scores" will be the least.

Hope you enjoy!!!
