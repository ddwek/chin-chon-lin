  of type "STAIR" and the second one of type "GROUP" or vice versa. You can
  test it by typing the following on the cmdline:
  chin-chon-lin --test-deck input-4-common-card.txt

* Add AC_CHECK_PROG autoconf's directive for testing existence of
  'glib-compile-resources'. However, you can still compile resource files
  by means of the traditional way.

* Add XML support for bugs reporting and replaying bogus matches in order to
  fix them easier.

* Networking is scheduled for v2.0+.
