Installation
------------

Make sure you can run the following commands on a terminal before doing anything else:

	username@host: dir $ pkg-config --libs gtk+-3.0
	username@host: dir $ pkg-config --libs librsvg-2.0

Those lines should be enough to query your local system libraries needed for
compile this game. In other words, you will need gtk+-3.0 and librsvg-2.0 installed
and running okay on your machine.

Having said that, to install using git and the GNU Build System method, just open
a terminal and type the following commands:

	username@host: dir $ git clone https://github.com/ddwek/chin-chon-lin chin-chon-lin
	username@host: dir $ cd chin-chon-lin
	username@host: chin-chon-lin $ ./configure CXXFLAGS="-Wall" --prefix=/usr/local
	username@host: chin-chon-lin $ make
	[ become superuser if needed ]
	username@host: chin-chon-lin $ make install-strip

Note that we have to modify the CXXFLAGS environment variable to "-Wall" in order to
produce code without any kind of warnings.

Last but not least, if you want to add support for localization, you must to do so
at configure-time; that is, after changing to the source directory type the following
line:

	username@host: chin-chon-lin $ ./configure CXXFLAGS="-Wall" --prefix=/usr/local --enable-nls=yes

Note that the final Makefile produced by 'configure' under "po/" subdirectory adds the
"all-yes" target for compilation, not "all-1" target, so that specifying "--enable-nls=1"
on the command line will lead to error.
